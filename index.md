## The game is done in two genres

- üè† build a settlement, or city-building
- ‚öíÔ∏è production simulation

## What's the city building genre?

In this genre players build settlements somewhere in wild lands. They start with primitive tools and resources like logs or stones picked on the map. Something like Minecraft but not as a first person :-). Slowly players build manufacturings that allow production of more sophisticated materials and goods like cannons, metal, ships, etc. Each building can be upgraded three times to increase the output. 

Each building in game has unique lowpoly style with three levels of upgrades.

Take an example, Sawmill ü™ö. Three levels of buildings all different but recognizable:

## What's about production simulation?

In this genre players have to form a production chain flow of primitive goods to be processed into something more sophisticated.

An example will help!

To produce a cannon <img src="sloboda2/images/uk/cannon.png" width="120">, players need: a metal, planks, gun powder and logs: <img src="sloboda2/images/uk/cannon_production.png" width="280">.

To get metal parts players need iron ore and coal:

To get iron ore players need to provide workers with food at Iron Ore Mine:

To get coal, players need to burn logs:

And in the end of this productino chain players get a cannon:
