# What's it about

Loca Deserta is an interactive game based on storytelling. All the stories are dedicated to historical
events that happened in Ukraine from the Middle Ages until modern day.

# About the book
The main hero is a Cossack. He agrees to sacrifice his life during the withdrawal of Khmelnytsky‚Äôs troops at the Battle of Berestechko. Along with a small group of soldiers manning boats, the protagonist fires at the advancing Polish forces, slowing their progress and saving the lives of countless Cossacks. At the end, he alone survives as his fellow brothers in arms perish one by one. Realizing what awaits him in Polish captivity, he decides to commit suicide. Loading his rifle, he jumps off the boat and shoots at his head. **However, the rifle misfires, and the Cossack is carried away by the swift current of the river. When he opens his eyes, he finds himself on the shores of a mysterious place ‚Äì Khortytsia Island.**

This island exists in **Warp**, from which it‚Äôs possible to travel to different places in time, helping warriors protect Ukraine. The island gathers the souls of warriors who couldn‚Äôt find peace neither in heaven nor hell. By committing suicide, the Cossack commits an unforgivable sin, but in his case, it is the only possible choice. As a result, his soul will live on the island forever. His soul, as well as the souls of other lost warriors, can settle into the bodies of Ukrainian heroes, helping them during crucial moments on the verge of life and death. Each such embodiment is a separate interactive story. **The stories don‚Äôt contain detailed descriptions of nature or long dialogs. You just need to decide on the action: Hit, Kill, Cut, Fire.** After the death or rescue of the embodied hero, the soul returns back to Khortytsia in Warp. 

## In this Cossack Version of Assasin‚Äôs Creed there are three story lines:
- **After the Battle**. Describes the misadventures of a captive after the Battle of Cecora
- **Khotyn Massacre**. Describes a night raid of a Turkish encampment by Cossacks. Based on the memoirs of German mercenaries. 
- **Meeting in the Steppe**. Describes the adventures of a Cossack brigade advancing on Tartars after the latter‚Äôs attack on Kaniv.

# Create your own interactive story
