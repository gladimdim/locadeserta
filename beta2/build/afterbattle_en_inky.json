The wispy clouds were driven westward, creating a covering for the weak light of the crescent moon. Dmytro couldn’t wait any longer. He had to do something. Gripping tightly a good combat knife, the only thing he managed to take from the boat when running away, he slowly crawled to the path that led to the river. He waited a while before getting up and, trying to step as lightly as possible, made his way to the river. There was no one on the dark path. He squatted and started to drink the cold river water, cupping it in his hand. From time to time, the moon and the thick clouds reflected on the river’s service. Suddenly, a girl’s face was seen. The man sprang back and stared at the spot where he had seen the bright eyes of a young girl. But there was nothing there – only the moonlight that sometimes shone through the clouds. He crossed himself and went back, whispering a prayer. Then he turned and made his way to where the wall of reeds ended.",

Dmytro left his camp and went to the edge of the island opposite to the one where he had landed. Cutting the reeds, he found that passage to the shore was quite clear here. The thickets weren’t so thick and near the shore there were a couple of stone blocks that created a small shelter. Dmytro left his clothing on the rocks and carefully entered the cold water of the Dnipro. Having entered the river up to his waist, he stopped, admiring the reflection of the stars in the water. Suddenly, he seemed to catch a glimpse of that young lady underwater again. Dmytro shook his head – it was most likely his weariness getting the better of him. Despite the cold, the bath brought a sense of relief and washed away the dust of his recent adventures. Returning to the shack, Dmytro barely waited for the fire to die down and fell soundly asleep.",

Up the current there was a network of straits and tributaries filled with countless small islands, and Dmytro hoped to continue his journey by hiding in the depths of this labyrinth. Currently, his goal was to cross the open space as quickly as possible before the sun had fully risen. Entering one of the straits, the runaway stopped paddling. The boat slid across the water without a sound. The current was much weaker here, so while the boat had stopped and started going backwards, Dmytro turned slightly and listened attentively. Then he made a couple of more strokes with the paddle, leveling the dugout canoe and guiding it forward. Repeating this movements many times, the Cossack slowly made his way through the thickets, trying not to lose his sense of direction. Even the current was no longer helping. In some areas it was hardly noticeable and in other areas the water seemed to move in a circle, pulling the boat into the center of the gyration. Suddenly, larger islands started to appear with patches of hard dry earth and even a couple of bushes. Dmytro went around these islands to the left, then to the right, until he approached a fairly large piece of land with several willows. The island was curved like a crescent moon, and Dmytro was approaching one of its tips while the other tip was visible from a distance. He led the boat to a small bay between the tips of the island. Dmytro surveyed the semicircle of the island’s sandy shore. At first, he didn’t see anything special, but a moment before he turned away something white flashed through the thickets. He vigorously paddled to turn back and surveyed the shallows once again. It seemed that in the depths of the island there was something white that resembled a piece of cloth tied to a tree or pole.",

He shook his shirt, put it on, and climbed into the pile. He had warmed himself by carrying out this task, and now, laying in a pile of dry grass and leaves, he felt completely at rest.

So Ustym brought axes and the team started to build a sledge that could be pulled by a horse. One of the volunteers – Ivan, as it turned out, was once a tinsmith, and he quickly created a harness from some ropes, belts and parts of old harnesses.

The tops of the trees weren’t even visible from the level steppe. All around, fairly large boulders protruded from the ground. When the travelers entered the forest, the boulders increased in size, laying among the trees in a blanket of bright green moss. Moving around, surprisingly, wasn’t difficult since there was almost no shrubbery in the forest. The even ground was covered with a deep layer of leaves and there was a good distance between the trees and boulders.

They stopped at a clearing surrounded by thickets on all sides. A semicircle of trees grew in the clearing, covering the passageway. Beneath the trees was a fire pit from rough stones and the remnants of some makeshift shelter. Ivan tethered the horse to a tree and the men carefully transported the wounded unto the grass.

It seemed that the labyrinth of reeds was endless, but Ustym confidently steered the boat and, finally, close to dusk, their boat slid through the open water and in a couple of hours landed at the opposite shore.

Close to the very edge of the forest he caught a glimpse of a fire up ahead. Dmytro turned in another direction, away from danger, until he made his way to a cluster of thickets on the edge of the open steppe. He was drenched to the skin and rivulets of water ran down his body. His clothing was heavy from moisture and his body – from exhaustion and hunger. At the same time, he was terribly thirsty. He squatted beside a shrub and greedily drank the droplets of water running down one of the branches. He then got up and grimly walked straight into the dark sea of cold steppe grasses. The rain continued falling. Dmytro completely lost track of time, slowly making his way forward through the Wild Fields. A small part of the steppe, which he saw in front of him, seemed to always look the same. At last, he began to see some small potholes, filled with water, and in time, behind the veil of rain and darkness, he glimpsed the downward slope of a valley. Walking downward, Dmytro slipped and tumbled to the very bottom of the valley. For a while he lay in the mud without moving. His head was spinning. The runaway tried to get up. It seemed that his bones weren’t broken, but he was quickly losing strength. The Cossack limped further down the valley, staggering like a drunk man. The stream near his feet had soon become a muddy and fast-running broad current that bubbled like a mountain river. Dmytro seemed to make out a tiny trail that led up the valley. When he had climbed up the slope to a landing, the downpour had subsided somewhat. However, the wind seemed to become stronger, blowing towards Dmytro moisture from the storm and heavy swaths of fog. It was starting to get lighter and Dmytro made out a dark shape on the hillock ahead of him. He used his last strength to trudge to the spot, his legs almost giving out. The shape turned out to be a small cave on a rocky outcropping. The entrance to the cave was wide but rather low. Not analyzing what he was doing, Dmytro fell onto the earth and crawled into the cave. Inside, it was surprisingly dry, but the space inside was small and narrow like a coffin, the ground covered in a thick layer of dry grass. Dmytro turned on his back and either fell asleep or lost consciousness.",

As you see, I ran away from the Tartars, but my Christian brothers almost drowned me.” He clearly remembered this young man who had once persuaded him to leave behind the registered Cossacks and set off for the Wild Fields. They were from the same region, from the Bila Tserkva subdivision. They had met during service and had good relations, but Stepan quickly disappeared after taking something from the treasury. “Good God!” Proclaimed Stepan and went to the center of the island with the others without saying anything more.

Finally, he was left on the ground and for a moment everything seemed to have subsided. He lay in the grass with his legs tied together by a rope and surrounded by several dozen Tartars. Dmytro couldn’t move a finger; he was completely exhausted. He was shivering from a high fever and all his joints were aching. He couldn’t see clearly due to red spots clouding his vision. Suddenly, he felt an acute pain in his right leg as though somebody had touched it with a piece of red-hot iron. Dmytro twitched but couldn’t make a sound. One of the Tartars lowered his bow, satisfied. Now another Tartar took a shot, bringing agonizing pain to Dmytro’s second leg. They continued to shoot until Dmytro had lost consciousness.",
