# Loca Deserta: Sloboda 2

This is a remake of [Loca Deserta: Sloboda](https://locadeserta.com/citybuilding/index_en.html) game.

# About the Game

You must build a settlement. You start with just two tools ü™ì‚õè, a forest üå≤ and some stoneüóø. 
Cut the trees, mine stone, build buildings, produce new materials, unlock areas.
Each new area gives you access to new buildings and more resources. Plan accordingly as some of the resources cannot be replenished!
Each new building allows you to produce more complicated materials, like guns, cannons, wagons and boats.
They are used to unlock next areas with more sophisticated production lines.

*The game is heavily inspired by [Unrailed!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1016920/Unrailed/)*
